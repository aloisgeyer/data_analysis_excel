# data_analysis_excel

This repository contains materials supporting data analysis with Excel. 

The file 'data_analysis.pdf' provides the statistical foundations in terms of lecture notes I use in my courses at WU and the WU Executive Academy. The file 'data_analysis.xlsx' contains the associated data and results referred to in the lecture notes.

I host a YouTube channel with a series of short videos (screen captures and spoken comments): https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLt1E_JvoRnTYJbdpl1mGmrL7qCLdLzaq9 

The file 'data_analysis_excel_work.xlsx' contains results of data analyses and the application of Excel functions shown in those videos.

The file 'data_analysis_excel_raw.xlsx' contains raw data used in those videos. This file is based on a previous version of the kaggle dataset https://www.kaggle.com/c/house-prices-advanced-regression-techniques/data (a subset of columns is selected from file 'train.csv'). This dataset is also used in the online tool 'analytics4exac.net' in the self-study questions 2.3, 3.14, 3.15, 4.12 and 4.13 (the filename in the online tool is '2.3.xlsx').
